# IEEE Final Task for the AI/ML SIG

## Readings
In this penultimate task for IEEE recruitments for the AI/ML SIG you'll be reading about the basics of neural networks and the math behind them. You'll also be reading about the softmax classifier and the cross-entropy loss function. And implement a basic two layer neural network classifier from scratch using numpy and train it on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- You should first get started with watching this short playlist explaining the intuition behind NNs. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=1>

- Then read this article about the backbone of all modern Deep Learning, backpropagation. <https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/>. Be sure to understand the fundamentals properly as this is key to solving the assignment.

- Then read the following articles explaining the loss function that we'll be implementing. Understand the math behind it because you'll need it to to complete the assignment.
  - <https://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/> (**only read the section about softmax classifier**)
  - <https://www.parasdahal.com/softmax-crossentropy>

- Lastly read the basics of a neural network, activation functions and a simple affine layer. <https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/>

## Assignment

- first run the bash/bat file to get the dataset:
  - for linux/mac users: `ieee/datasets/get_datasets.sh`
  - for windows users: `ieee/datasets/get_datasets.bat`
- Follow the python notebook named `two_layer_net.ipynb`.

## Instructions

Be sure to understand all the code you're writing thoroughly. We know that we cannot prevent you from using online implements or ai tools for writing the solutions and we dont expect you to write everything from scratch. But we do expect you to understand the code you're writing and be able to explain it to us if asked.
